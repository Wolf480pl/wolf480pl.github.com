      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>I'm a Linux geek from Poland. I use Arch Linux with a custom DE (compiz + cairo-dock + screenlets). I like programming. 
         I know some of C, C++, Python, Lua, and Lisp, but most of the stuff I code in Java.</p>

      <h3>Neons</h3>
      <p>As you've probably guessed by the looks of my website, I like neon-ish looking things, i.e. dark backgrounds and intensive highlights 
         in <span class="saturated-color-1" style="/*color: #0FF*/" title="color: #0FF">saturated</span> <span class="saturated-color-2" style="/*color: #0F0*/" title="color: #0F0">colors</span>, 
         with <span class="glowish-shadow" style="/*color: #FF0; text-shadow: 0px 0px 4px;*/" title="color: #FF0; text-shadow: 0px 0px 4px;">glow-ish shadows</span>, etc. 
         I also like computer-themed movies with this kind of aesthetics, like <cite>Matrix</cite> or <cite>TRON:Legacy</cite>. Dunno if the former caused the latter, or the other way 
         around, but it's easier to find a cool neon-looking thing than a good computer-themed movie.</p>

      <h3>Movies and Music</h3>
      <p>Aside from <cite>Matrix</cite> <small>(all 3 movies)</small> and <cite>TRON</cite> <small>(both)</small>, I also enjoyed watching <cite>War&nbsp;Games</cite>, <cite>Stargate</cite> <small>(the original movie, <cite>SG-1</cite> series, a bit of <cite>Atlantis</cite> 
         series, and <cite>Ark of Truth</cite> movie)</small> and BBC's&nbsp;<cite>Sherlock</cite>.</p>
      <p>As for music, I like <cite>Daft&nbsp;Punk</cite> <small>(esp. <cite>Harder Better Faster Stronger</cite> and <cite>Technologic</cite>)</small>, <cite>EnV</cite>'s soundtrack for <cite>Electronic Super Joy</cite> <small>(never played the 
         game though)</small>,  Armin&nbsp;van&nbsp;Buuren <small>(esp. <cite>J'ai envie de toi</cite>)</small>, Matt&nbsp;McFarland's <cite>Cyber&nbsp;Advance</cite> <small>(btw. it's CreativeCommons)</small>, and electronic music in general.</p>

      <h3>Anime</h3>
      <p>I thought <cite>Naruto</cite> and <cite>Naruto: Shippuuden</cite> were cool. Then I watched <cite>Steins;Gate</cite>, and man, it was amazing. <cite>Naruto</cite> sucks, compared to that. Then I watched 
         <cite>Robotics;Notes</cite> and 80% of <cite>Death Note</cite>. These were pretty impressive, too. As a result, I decided I'm gonna try to learn Japanese instead of German.</p>

      <h3>Coding</h3>
      <p>I like <b>challenges</b>, and I like <b>solving problems</b>. I especially enjoy coding things which were never made before, either because nobody thought of it,
         or because everybody thinks it's impossible. I also like to make my code <b>universal</b>, and (according to The Unix Way) suitable for use cases I didn't
         think of. That's why my code is complex <small>(at least according to certain definitions of "complex")</small>. However, while simple is better than
         complex, complex is better than complicated. And trying to hide complexity makes things complicated. <b>Complexity should be exposed.</b> This is what
         The Arch Way says, and I fully agree with it. I also strive for <b>perfection</b>, "just works" is not enough for me.</p>
