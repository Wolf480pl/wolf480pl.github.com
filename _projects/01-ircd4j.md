shortdesc: a Java IRC server library
---
a Java IRC server library. Uses Netty under the hood. Initially I wanted to make an IRC<->XMPP MUC reverse proxy, but started with the IRC server part (there are alredy nice XMPP client libraries for Java). I didn't have time to finish it, but hey, the IRC server part may be useful for someone, even if only the low-level protocol parts are implemented.
