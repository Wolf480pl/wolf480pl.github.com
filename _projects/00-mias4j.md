shortdesc: Method Interception and Sandboxing
---
a Java method interception framework based on ObjectWeb's ASM bytecode manipulation library. Can be used for sandboxing untrusted code, and for many other interesting purposes. So far the core is functional, but I'm gonna add some default policies, so that people can mix and match them to build their sandboxes quicker. **Peer review is extremely welcome**.
